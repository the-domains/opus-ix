About Us

JT Global was founded to promote a healthy lifestyle using cordyceps based natural supplements. Cordycepin, a compound isolated from cordyceps, have been found in Vitro studies to have some effects such as anti-cancer activities, repairing liver damage, anti-depressant effects, protection of bone marrow and digestive systems from radiations, and hypoglycemic effects.

Our products are "cultivated" in a controlled and sterile environment, giving us a more potent product that those harvested in the wild. We cultivate in three different methodologies based on different fungi families of 0901, each giving us an unique application for the methods for generations and generations.
