OPUS IX in Taiwan

1\. OPUS IX's Cordyceps Militaris is cultivated on specially formulated substrate (organic rice) which provides all of the required nutrients for optimum bio activity:

(1) Mycelium is introduced in the sterilized bottle on organic rice substrate  
(2) Mycelium germinates via photosynthesis  
(3) Cordyceps Militaris continues to germinate in the sterile & controlled environment (oxygen, temperature, humidity metrics are tightly controlled to optimize growth)

2\. Polymeric Nano‐Delivery System ‐ Nanomaterials for targeted delivery are uniquely capable of localizing delivery as well as more efficient dosing and loading

(1) Circulation time can be prolonged and controlled  
(2) Enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, shape adaptability also optimizes biodistribution  
(3) Improved nanoparticle association with the target cells' membranes and uptake like a homing device  
(4) Hydrogel nanoparticles have advantageous pH‐sensitive properties for controlled loading and release  
(5) Neutralization of surface charge has been associated with decreased opsonization and improved blood retention time
