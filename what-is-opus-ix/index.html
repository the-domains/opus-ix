Over two-third of cancer-related deaths could be prevented or reduced by modifying our diet with mushrooms, as they contain anti-oxidants. <strong>Cordyceps</strong> have a history of medicinal use spanning millennia in parts of Asia. An entomopathogenic fungus, <strong>Cordyceps</strong> sp. has been known to have numerous pharmacological and therapeutic implications, especially, in terms of human health making it a suitable candidate for ethno-pharmacological use. Main constituent of the extract derived from this fungus comprises a novel bio-metabolite called as Cordycepin (3′deoxyadenosine) which has a very potent anti-cancer, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. There has been many medicinal reviews on the broad spectrum potential of Cordycepin including biological and pharmacological actions in immunological, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular systems as well as an anti-cancer agent.</p><p>The name <strong>Cordyceps</strong> has been derived from two Latin words, i.e., cord and ceps meaning club and head, respectively.<strong>Cordyceps</strong><strong>militaris</strong> belongs to the phylum Ascomycota classified in the order hypocreales, as spores are produced internally inside a sac, called ascus. <strong>Cordyceps</strong> has been found mainly in North America, Europe and Asia. The ethnopharmacological use of <strong>Cordyceps</strong> sinensis has been reported from western Nepal for the cure of different diseases like diarrhea, headache, cough, rheumatism, liver disease, etc. This herb is also referred as “Himalayan Viagra” or “Himalayan Gold” due to its broad clinical and commercial value. <strong>Cordyceps</strong> requires specific set of conditions for its growth and has small size; therefore, the large-scale collection of this mushroom is a daunting task.</p><p>There have been a variety of pharmacologically active compounds (e.g., Cordycepin) reported from <strong>Cordyceps</strong> sp. Cordycepin has received much attention due to its broad-spectrum biological activity. It is known to interfere with various biochemical and molecular processes including purine biosynthesis, DNA/RNA synthesis and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling transduction. <strong>Cordyceps</strong> has been included as one of the growing numbers of fungal traditional Chinese medicine (FTCM) used as cures for modern diseases with many products available commercially. Due to recent advancements in pharmaceutical biotechniques, it is possible to isolate bioactive compounds from <strong>Cordyceps</strong> and make it available in powder as well as in capsular form (e.g., Didanosine). <strong>Cordyceps</strong> and its product have remarkable clinical health effects including action on hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, sexual, immunological systems, besides having anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial activities.</p><p>Nutritional value of <strong>Cordyceps</strong></p><p>In <strong>Cordyceps</strong>, there occurs a wide range of nutritionally important components including various types of essential amino acids, vitamins like B1, B2, B12 and K, different kinds of carbohydrates such as monosaccharide, oligosaccharides and various medicinally important polysaccharides, proteins, sterols, nucleosides, and other trace elements. In the fruiting body and in the corpus of <strong>Cordyceps militaris</strong>, the reported total free amino acid content is 69.32 and 14.03 mg/g, respectively. The fruiting body harbors many abundant amino acids such as lysine, glutamic acid, proline and threonine as well. The fruiting body is also rich in unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., linoleic acid), which comprises of about 70 % of the total fatty acids. There are differences in adenosine (0.18 and 0.06 %) and Cordycepin (0.97 and 0.36 %) contents between the fruiting body and the corpus, respectively.</p><p>Cordycepin, or 3′-deoxyadenosine, is a derivative of the nucleoside adenosine, differing from the latter by the absence of the hydroxy group in the 3′ position of its ribose part. It was initially extracted from the fungus <strong>Cordyceps militaris</strong>, but is now produced synthetically. Because cordycepin is similar to adenosine, some enzymes cannot discriminate between the two. Therefore, it can participate in certain biochemical reactions (for example, be incorporated into an RNA molecule, thus causing the premature termination of its synthesis). Cordycepin has displayed cytotoxicity against some leukemic cell lines in vitro, and at least one clinical trial of cordycepin as a leukemia treatment is in progress. Cordycepin has been found to produce rapid, robust ketamine-like antidepressant effects in animal models of depression, and these effects, similarly to those of ketamine, are dependent on enhancement of AMPA receptor signaling.</p><p><strong>OPUS IX</strong></p><p>The cultivation of precious natural varieties in Taiwan ensures zero pollution and is SGS certified.
