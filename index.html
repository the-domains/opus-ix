Over two-third of cancer-related deaths could be prevented or reduced by modifying our diet with mushrooms, as they contain anti-oxidants. Cordyceps have a history of medicinal use spanning millennia in parts of Asia. An entomopathogenic fungus, Cordyceps sp. has been known to have numerous pharmacological and therapeutic implications, especially, in terms of human health making it a suitable candidate for ethno-pharmacological use. Main constituent of the extract derived from this fungus comprises a novel bio-metabolite called as Cordycepin (3′deoxyadenosine) which has a very potent anti-cancer, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. There has been many medicinal reviews on the broad spectrum potential of Cordycepin including biological and pharmacological actions in immunological, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular systems as well as an anti-cancer agent.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="62"><p data-reactid="63">The name Cordyceps has been derived from two Latin words, i.e., cord and ceps meaning club and head, respectively.Cordycepsmilitaris belongs to the phylum Ascomycota classified in the order hypocreales, as spores are produced internally inside a sac, called ascus. Cordyceps has been found mainly in North America, Europe and Asia. The ethnopharmacological use of Cordyceps sinensis has been reported from western Nepal for the cure of different diseases like diarrhea, headache, cough, rheumatism, liver disease, etc. This herb is also referred as “Himalayan Viagra” or “Himalayan Gold” due to its broad clinical and commercial value. Cordyceps requires specific set of conditions for its growth and has small size; therefore, the large-scale collection of this mushroom is a daunting task.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="64"><p data-reactid="65">There have been a variety of pharmacologically active compounds (e.g., Cordycepin) reported from Cordyceps sp. Cordycepin has received much attention due to its broad-spectrum biological activity. It is known to interfere with various biochemical and molecular processes including purine biosynthesis, DNA/RNA synthesis and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling transduction. Cordyceps has been included as one of the growing numbers of fungal traditional Chinese medicine (FTCM) used as cures for modern diseases with many products available commercially. Due to recent advancements in pharmaceutical biotechniques, it is possible to isolate bioactive compounds from Cordyceps and make it available in powder as well as in capsular form (e.g., Didanosine). Cordyceps and its product have remarkable clinical health effects including action on hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, sexual, immunological systems, besides having anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial activities.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="66"><p data-reactid="67">Nutritional value of Cordyceps</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="68"><p data-reactid="69">In Cordyceps, there occurs a wide range of nutritionally important components including various types of essential amino acids, vitamins like B1, B2, B12 and K, different kinds of carbohydrates such as monosaccharide, oligosaccharides and various medicinally important polysaccharides, proteins, sterols, nucleosides, and other trace elements. In the fruiting body and in the corpus of Cordyceps militaris, the reported total free amino acid content is 69.32 and 14.03 mg/g, respectively. The fruiting body harbors many abundant amino acids such as lysine, glutamic acid, proline and threonine as well. The fruiting body is also rich in unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., linoleic acid), which comprises of about 70 % of the total fatty acids. There are differences in adenosine (0.18 and 0.06 %) and Cordycepin (0.97 and 0.36 %) contents between the fruiting body and the corpus, respectively.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="70"><p data-reactid="71">Cordycepin, or 3′-deoxyadenosine, is a derivative of the nucleoside adenosine, differing from the latter by the absence of the hydroxy group in the 3′ position of its ribose part. It was initially extracted from the fungus Cordyceps militaris, but is now produced synthetically. Because cordycepin is similar to adenosine, some enzymes cannot discriminate between the two. Therefore, it can participate in certain biochemical reactions (for example, be incorporated into an RNA molecule, thus causing the premature termination of its synthesis). Cordycepin has displayed cytotoxicity against some leukemic cell lines in vitro, and at least one clinical trial of cordycepin as a leukemia treatment is in progress. Cordycepin has been found to produce rapid, robust ketamine-like antidepressant effects in animal models of depression, and these effects, similarly to those of ketamine, are dependent on enhancement of AMPA receptor signaling.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="72"><p data-reactid="73">OPUS IX</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="74"><p data-reactid="75">The cultivation of precious natural varieties in Taiwan ensures zero pollution and is SGS certified.

Nomads can earn about 2,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan (about U.S. $260 to $653 ) through their work during the fifty-day Chinese caterpillar fungus gathering season. Chinese caterpillar fungus, about U.S. $600 per pound, is also called Cordyceps Sinensis Mushroom. The fungus multiples by parasitizing insect larvae, forming hypha and maturing outside the larva. The fungus exists in mountains and meadows with an altitude of 9,840 to 16,400 feet. Caterpillar fungus is highly valued in Chinese medicine and used in drugs to restore energy, promote longevity and stimulate the immune system, however, because of excessive exploitation, the Chinese caterpillar fungus resource has been destroyed and has become increasingly rare. The Chinese government has restricted the digging of the fungus.
